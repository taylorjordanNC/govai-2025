= Conclusion to Deployment Setup Module

== What We've Deployed

You now have a complete Llama Stack deployment running on OpenShift AI:

- **vLLM Model Server** - Llama 3.2 3B model serving via vLLM inference runtime
- **Llama Stack Operator** - Kubernetes operator managing the Llama Stack infrastructure
- **OpenShift MCP Server** - Model Context Protocol server for cluster integration
- **Llama Stack Server** - Core platform with model connectivity and tool support
- **Llama Stack Playground** - Web UI for testing and experimentation

== Architecture Overview

The deployment follows a microservices architecture where:
- vLLM handles model inference and serving
- Llama Stack provides the unified API and agent framework
- MCP servers enable tool integration and external system connectivity
- The operator manages the lifecycle and configuration

== Next Steps

In Module 2, we'll explore the agentic capabilities of your deployed Llama Stack, including:
- Agent configuration and tool integration
- MCP server utilization for DevOps operations
- Advanced prompting and multi-step reasoning

Your infrastructure is ready for agentic AI workloads.
