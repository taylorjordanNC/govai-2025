= Game Time

You're still the developer. Now that your AI assistant is wired up, it's time to get your hands dirty - by building a simple game using Continue's help. In this module, you're not solving a business-critical problem… **yet**! You're exploring, experimenting, and building confidence with AI-assisted coding through something fun: a simple game.

== Choose a Game to Build

Pick **one** of the following lightweight game projects, available in both Python and Bash:

. **Rock Paper Scissors**: Play rock, paper, scissors against the computer!
. **Word Scramble**: The program scrambles a word and the user has to guess what it is.
. **Simple Quiz Game**: The program asks a few trivia questions and then gives a final score.

You only need to pick one - but feel free to try more if you have time.

== Open Your Starter File

From the file explorer, navigate to the `game_starters` directory:

Open the game file of your preference, in the language of your choice.

The files in the `game_starters` folder include instructions as comments to build and extend the game application using our Continue AI assistant!

== Use Continue to Build and Enhance

Once you have opened the file you wish to work on, click the `Continue` extension tab again on the left-hand side of the VS Code window. You may toggle between the `Explorer` and `Continue` tabs as you need.

=== How to Use Continue

You may use the chat interface function to ask any questions about your code or to input the suggested chat prompts from your starter files. To interact directly with the code itself, you will need to `highlight` and `right-click` on whatever parts of the code you'd like to work on. When you right-click, you will then click on `Continue` in the pop-up menu:

Here is a short description of each of the Continue options so that you will understand how to use them properly:

**Add Highlighted Code to Context** - Shares the selected code with Continue's chat interface so you can ask questions about it or reference it in conversation

**Edit Highlighted Code** - Opens a new Edit-mode chat interface where you can describe how you want the selected code modified (e.g., "make this function async" or "add error handling")

**Fix this Code** - Automatically analyzes the selected code for bugs, syntax errors, or logical issues and suggests corrections

**Optimize this Code** - Reviews the selected code for performance improvements, better algorithms, or more efficient approaches

**Write a Docstring for this Code** - Generates documentation strings that explain what the selected function or class does, its parameters, and return values

**Write Comments for this Code** - Adds inline comments to explain what the selected code is doing, making it more readable and maintainable

Follow the guidance in the file comments, or ask your own questions - this is your playground!

IMPORTANT: Ensure any text that does not contribute to the game code stays as a comment. 

=== Begin Building Your Game

Your `game_starter` files are designed to be a starting point for you to build your game. All of the files begin with a **"Start by asking Continue's chat"** suggested prompt to input into your chat interface. This will give you a starting file to build from.

NOTE: Once you have this starting file, **copy/paste** the content from the chatbot into the game file. Ensure the game content is not commented out and that the comments that do not contribute to the game code are properly commented out.

Follow the guidance in the file comments, or ask your own questions - this is your playground!

== Run (and Play) Your Game

Once complete, save your file(s) that you wish to test.

We will use the Terminal capability within VSCode to test our applications. To open a terminal session navigate to `Terminal` -> `New Terminal` from the hamburger menu in the navigation bar of the VSCode app. Or you may press `CTRL` + ```.

Navigate to the file's folder:

Example [substitute the correct path to your file]

[source,console]
----
cd /projects/llama-stack-on-ocp/fun-and-games/game_starters/rock_paper_scissors/rock_paper_scissors.py
----

Follow the instructions for the right code language:

=== Python (.py)

Run the following command (substitute your filename):

[source,console]
----
python your_filename.py
----

=== Bash (.sh)

Make the file executable (you only need to do this once). Substitute your filename:

[source,console]
----
chmod +x your_filename.sh
----

Run the following command (substitute your filename):

[source,console]
----
./your_filename.sh
----

=== Troubleshooting

**If you see a "command not found" or "permission denied" error**:

* Double-check the file name is spelled correctly

* Make sure you’re in the correct directory (ls to list files)

* For .sh files, try `bash yourfile.sh` if `./yourfile.sh` doesn't work.

**Other error or application isn't working as expected**:

* Use your code assistant to help you debug

* Feed the errors or explain any issues in the extension chat and have the AI help you correct your code

== Stuck? Peek at a Solution

Solutions are available here:

[source,console]
----
~/llama-stack-on-ocp/fun-and-games/game_solutions/
----

Use the execution instructions in the above sections to run the code for any of the provided game programs!

== Taking the Next Step

You've now used Continue in a real, yet low-pressure, context - scaffolding, editing, testing and debugging a working application!

In the next activity, we'll bring our new set of skills to deploying an MCP server into our cluster for our organization.
